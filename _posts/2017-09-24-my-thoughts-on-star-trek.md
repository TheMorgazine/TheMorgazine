Tonight, the Star Trek franchise will enter uncharted territory when a brand-new series airs on CBS called “Star Trek: Discovery.” Although I am unsure about its quality or longevity, I am planning on watching it tonight. I’ll also be reacting via Twitter, so if anybody else wants to follow along or jump in with their comments my handle is @morga2ja.

I was at the local library yesterday trying to pick a movie to rent, when I happened to glance at their collection of TV shows on DVD. It occurred to me how much TV programming their two bookshelves represented. Among the selections were of course Star Trek, Firefly, X-Files, Fringe, Dr. Who, and many other shows.

This is remarkable to me, because back when I was a kid there definitely was not as many choices for sci-fi on TV. The shows I do remember watching around the time I was ten or twelve were “Lost in Space,” “Star Trek,” “The Incredible Hulk,” “Wonder Woman,” “Buck Rogers,” and “Battlestar Galactica.” These shows were beam to our TV on a regular basis courtesy of a cool little thing called TV syndication. They were basically reruns of old or cancelled TV shows which were being shown on different UHF channels. For the curious, I’m fairly sure that “UHF” stood for “Good luck if you want to see this channel clearly, because there is no way you’ll ever position the antenna in exactly the right spot.” I once gave myself a headache because I caught an episode of “Battlestar Galactica” on one of the more obscure channels, but couldn’t get it in very clearly. I basically just tried to see around all of the interference on the screen.

So, I very much gravitated towards “Star Trek.” I owned a little toy phaser. There was a little bit of an alcove in the dining room in our first house which I pretended was a transporter room. I very much saw Mr. Spock. I very much loved seeing the <i>Enterprise</i> in space, or all of the different special effects. It didn’t really matter to me that the special effects were outdated, because at the time what did I have it to compare it to? “Lost in Space” was made right around the other time, and while more modern “Battlestar Galactica” and “Buck Rogers” were just as limited by their shoestring, TV budgets. And, I was too young to really noticed William Shatner’s overacting.

My favorite original Star Trek episodes were “Space Seed,” whatever title they gave the one where they battled the planet killer, the one episode with the space parasites, and “The Tholian Web.” In my adult years, I’ve also grown to like more thoughtful episodes like “City on the Edge of Forever.”

In September 1987 I had a new chance to become a fan of Star Trek all over again when “Star Trek: The Next Generation” premiered. I remember watching the two part pilot episode on my birthday, although Google says that it premiered on September 28, 1987, so maybe I remember it being my birthday but it was the next weekend right after it.

I caught each series after that. “DeepSpace Nine” was a spin-off of TNG which was broadcasted as another syndicated series. “Voyager” was the first series to be shown on a broadcast network since the original series, although since the network showing it was UPN that’s not such an accomplishment. After “Voyager” ended, there was “Enterprise,” which took place before the original series.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how my and Star Trek’s histories have been tied together. Again, I’m celebrating another birthday and, as I may have mentioned, getting ready to watch the beginning of a new Star Trek show. This is a great time to be a Star Trek fan, right?

I guess. But the backstory for the production of “Star Trek: Discovery” has been sounding pretty crazy, and I am not too keen on the idea of CBS airing the rest of the season on their exclusive, subscription-only streaming service. The vibe I’m getting is that CBS just wants to kickstart their Netflix competitor, and they’re using the Star Trek brand to do it. They did it once again (or, Viacom did) when they launched UPN and made “Voyager” their flagship show. I remember reading once that back in the mid-1970’s, there was talk of starting up a new network, and if “Star Trek Phase II” had been greenlit as a TV show instead of as the very first movie then it would have been on this brand-new network.

So, basically, this is an example of corporate executives not only taking from the same bag of tricks, but trying the same exact thing over, and over, and over again. Will they be successful this time? It is too soon to say for sure, but I’d have to say that it’s really tacky to force your audience to pay for a subscription service just so they can watch one new show. I think that this stems from the fact that CBS sees what Netflix has been doing, and what HBO has achieved with shows like “Game of Thrones,” and wants a piece of the action.

Part of the back story is the complaint from long time fans that “Discovery” will change a lot of elements that we’ve come to expect from Star Trek. The Klingons are different, the technology doesn’t fit within a time frame that comes before Kirk and Spock. The <i>U.S. S. Discovery </i>is ugly (well, I can’t really argue against that).

I have thought about this a lot, and if you really look at the history of Star Trek’s production, they all originate from the very first movie when the budget was a lot bigger and they could take things a little farther with set construction, makeup, alien designs, etc. Mr. Worf, from the “Next Generation” was a Klingon with ridges on his head. Why? Because the Klingons from the movies had ridges, and the look of the movie Klingons originated with “Star Trek: The Motion Picture.” So, if you flip that around, you start to realize that Klingons have looked they way they do because some guy back in the 1970’s made a few creative decisions. The sets from the motion picture were redressed for at least the first season of TNG.

It’s not a bad thing that sets and makeup designs were recycled. It saved money for the studio and allowed them to create other things that were way more interesting. But, maybe the people behind “ST:Discovery” got together and agreed to throw out everything that had been done before for other Star Trek shows because very little of it felt fresh. I’m not sure that I’ll love the look of the new Klingons, but I think I will be able to look past it. I’ll let you know later.

The biggest variable affecting the premiere of the new Star Trek show, however, is a Star Trek lookalike currently being aired on FOX called “The Orville.” Say what you will about this other show, but it will steal a little bit of thunder from “Star Trek.” I’ve watched the first three episodes, and it has a lot going for it. It is familiar, because it is set on a ship and the cast of characters perform ship roles which are similar to the ensemble we saw on TNG. But, judging from the third episode of the season, “The Orville” will fearlessly go places with its storylines that perhaps the other Star Trek series refused to go. If “The Orville” is the counter-Star Trek, then “Discovery” will need to be twice as bold to stay ahead of it <i>and </i>satisfy fans who will no doubt compare it to previous Star Trek series.
