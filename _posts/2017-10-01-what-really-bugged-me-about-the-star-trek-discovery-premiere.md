Now that it’s been a week, and I’ve had some time to think things over I think I’m ready to write about the one thing that bothered me the most about the “Star Trek: Discovery” premiere. It really didn’t have so much to do with the actual show, or the fact that it is on CBS’ membership-only video streaming service. What bugged the most about the premiere is that I thought they were going to show both hours of the two-part pilot, but they really only showed the first part then referred viewers to their streaming service, where you couldn’t finish watching the pilot without paying for a subscription (Okay, so maybe it had a little more to do with the streaming service).

I felt like I had been tricked. I had settled down with my iPad in hand, and asked my fourteen year old son to watch with me, because I thought that this was going to be a major, two hour long kick-off for a series that would then be accessible only to CBS All Access subscribers.

It didn’t help that the evening’s showing of “Star Trek: Discovery” ended--at least, for anybody who didn’t intend to subscribe--at a point where the story was still ramping up. I know I really shouldn’t complain about this, because I wouldn’t expect anything less from a two-parter that is going to throw in a plot twist at the 50 minute mark just to keep their audience watching. In fact, kudos to everybody for creating so much tension. But, “boo” for then moving the second hour and conclusion of the two-part pilot behind the paywall.

Somewhere, I just think that the messaging in the marketing was a little bit askew. I am sure that everywhere I read during the week prior to the premiere, articles said that the pilot would be two episodes long, that the episodes would premiere Sunday night, and then subsequent episodes would be available via the exclusive streaming service only. CBS even had a time slot <i>available </i>for the second episode, but instead filled it with an episode of “NCIS:LA.” I mean, WTF?

Here is what they could have done: Stated everywhere that the first episode would air, then the series would continue with the second part on CBS All Access and Netflix, etc. But, do you know what? I doubt I would have been as likely to tune in knowing that I’d never be able to see the ending. That would be like paying to see a movie in the movie theater knowing that I’ll need to leave the movie theater before it’s over so that I can make it to a shift at work. It just wouldn’t make sense.

I think that CBS used the confusion over how their new streaming service will work to their advantage by saying that both episodes would air Sunday night, which was technically true, without clarifying that only paying subscribers would see the second episode. I think that they wanted to create demand for the show that they wouldn’t have if they simply aired the two episodes on their network, or if they premiered the series entirely inside their streaming service. In one scenario they would be, as the saying goes, giving the cow away for free, and in the other scenario they would be creating too large of a barrier for people to see the show.

Either way, the bottom line for why I was angry about not being able to see the second episode is that I had become invested into the series. I was intrigued about who the new characters were, how the two ships would fit into the series, and up until the fifty-five minute mark I was curious to see how the story in the two-part premiere would be concluded. I was ready to become a fan of Star Trek all over again, just like I’ve done for the previous series.
