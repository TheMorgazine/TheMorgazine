For me, the years when each of our kids attended school for the very first time will always seem the most monumental. That is the kind of year that four-year-old Elijah is having this year, as he has been attending preschool. I still fondly remember Kayla’s first day of Kindergarten, and Josh’s first days of school for both Headstart and Kindergarten as though they were not that long ago.

Now that our oldest two are in high school, the first day of the school year should probably feel “old hat.” But, each grade they’ve entered, and each grade they’ve completed, have been milestones. This is Kayla’s senior year in high school, so these next few months will be anything but ordinary. Already she’s been having her senior pictures taken, gowns are being ordered, and college plans are being discussed as she chooses the career she will be pursuing beyond high school. I always knew that these moments would come--I went through them myself--but when your kids are small, like Elijah is now, it all seems so far away. I’m not sure what happen, but things got busy in the middle and now here we are.

Josh is close on his sister’s heels. He started his Freshman year at Shepherd High School. I’d like to say that we will get all of the kinks worked out by the time he is graduating high school, but it will all be different for him when the time comes.

No matter what happens, this year will go down in our history as a year of transition. The year Kayla graduated high school, Josh’s first year of high school, and Elijah’s first year attending a school of any form. All this really does is remind me of how short my stint as parenting really is. We’ve gone from one baby, to two babies, then one baby, and now no babies and two young adults.

I feel like my experience as a parent has been too fleeting. It’s all been like trying to catch every drop of water in a stream. You can bottle it, you can hold it in buckets you can try to grab it with your fingers, but it moves too fast to get it all. I think over time I’ve learned to just appreciate the stream, and let the drops fall where they may. I hope that my experience will help improve me as a father as we continue to raise Elijah, and that I can support Kayla and Josh as they continue on into adulthood.
