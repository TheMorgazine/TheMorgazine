<h1>One</h1>
My adventure started just a few minutes after the conclusion of this month’s historical society meeting. The society president, Larry, tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me about the box of assorted treasures which had recently been donated to the society’s historical museum. There was one item in particular that he wanted to show me.

“It’s a dust buster,” I said, when he dug it out of the box. But, as I looked more closely at it I realized that it had the long, angled nose and the narrow handle of the classic dustbuster, but a few other odd additions. Notably a keypad on the top of it which looked like an old styled cell phone which had been disassembled. A thick battery jutted out through the bottom.

“What do you make of it?” Larry asked.

“I don’t know, does it work?” I asked, growing more and more curious by the minute. I turned it around, and looked for the slot where the dirt would normally be sucked in through, but any gap which was there originally had been placed by some kind of lens. Behind the lens there was a myriad of wires. “Who was the donor?”

“Anonymous,” Larry said, shrugging. He reached in, and pulled out a large suitcase. “This was in the box, too.” He released the latches on the front with a click, and lifted the lid. Inside, the suitcase was filled with neatly folded clothes.

I pawed through the clothes, identifying a pair of pants, some button-up shirts, a business tie, and even a couple of t-shirts. Then, my hand hit upon something hard beneath the stacks of clothes. I pulled out, and recognized one of the corners from the battery pack which was inserted into the dustbuster.

I pulled and pushed the battery pack, hoping to remove it from the dustbuster. It was Larry who found the release button. I pressed, and the battery slid right off.

I picked up the second battery we had found in the suitcase, and slipped it into place beneath the dustbuster. I set the original battery aside.

Picking up the device again, I tried using the power switch to turn it on, without luck. Next, I pressed and held down the power button on the keypad. To both of our surprise, the screen lit up. A message tickered across the digital screen:

<i>Enter a Destination Date</i>

“Do you have any idea what it’s asking for?” Larry asked. I shook my head.

I thought for a bit, then for the fun of it entered <i>09-23-2000.</i>

“Why that date?” Larry asked.

“That’s when my daughter was born.” The date didn’t seem to register at first, so I tried a couple of buttons. The screen changed after I hit the button marked “SND.”

<i>Enter Destination Time</i>

By now I felt like I was playing some kind of game. Wanting to stay consistent, I entered <i>7 a.m.</i> Next, it asked for a location. I entered Sparrow Hospital, Lansing, Michigan.

I hit “SND” one last time. The dustbuster began to hum, and the handle began to vibrate a little bit.

“What’s it doing?” Larry asked.

“I don’t know. Should I switch it on?” I could see on the right side of the device there was a red bar labeled “BATT” which seemed to be growing with every passing minute or so. It was now a quarter of the way filled. The hum was growing louder.

“Maybe we should take it outside,” Larry urged.

Agreeing, Larry placed the other battery inside the suitcase, sealed it, and then followed me downstairs into the museum’s garage space. I aimed the dustbuster at the garage door. By now, the thing was shaking so much it was difficult to aim it straight, and the hum was changing to a low whine.

I steadied my feet, aimed the device with both hands, and flipped the switch. There was an immediate pop, and then a whoosh as a bright beam of light shot out from the end of the dustbuster with so much force that I was thrown back onto the floor. Whatever the light was, it was as bright as a car headlight and at first I thought that it had somehow burned through the garage doors. But, as I watched closely I realized that we were not looking out into the darkened streets of Shepherd. Instead, we were looking at the clean hallway of a hospital. Doctors and nurses passed by as if caught by a surveillance camera. The whole thing seemed surreal, as though a movie had been projected onto the surface of the door.

I stood back up, dumbfounded. Dusting myself off, I wandered close to the projected image, as though I might catch some detail up close that I could see from where I had been standing. As I walked closer and closer, I felt a growing attraction towards the image, as though I had suddenly been caught by the wind. I would have fallen over if Larry had not grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back.

“Careful,” he exclaimed. “We don’t know what this is.”

“It’s a movie of some kind,” I said. “They turned the dustbuster into some kind of portable projector.”

“I don’t think so.” Larry said. He paused, glanced around, then walked over and grabbed a small wrench from a nearby toolbox. Then, he stood in front of the visage of the hospital again until an orderly pushing a cart walked into view. He chucked the wrench at the door.

We both expected the tool to bounce off. Instead, it slipped through the portion of door which had been hit by the light, and then continued on into the frame of the shot. It hit the orderly in the back of his leg. Startled, the man stopped, looked down shaking his leg as if it had hurt, and picked up the wrench.

“Oh my Lord,” Larry muttered. We both looked at the dustbuster. The battery indicator was now at fifty percent, and we had no clue how much power it took for it to do what it was doing. Did we use up juice when we fired the projection, or did it take battery life in order to sustain it?

“Could this be some kind of time machine?” I asked. Larry didn’t say anything. He didn’t have to, because I was thinking the same thing: There was only one way to find out.

We moved quickly after that point. Larry ran up to the third floor and found an old lab coat which he felt might make me look more like a doctor. I also changed into one of the dress shirts from the suitcase. The battery was a third of the way full when we were back in front of the garage door and again peering into this strange abyss that had been opened up. I slipped on the lab coat. Larry also offered me goggles just in case I would need them.

I emptied the contents of the suitcase into a duffle bag. I swung its strap over my head, then gripped the dustbuster firmly with my hands. I counted to five in my head, then bolted confidently towards the projected image of the hospital hallway, half expecting to ram right into the wood frame of the garage door. Instead, there was only a little bit of tension, like in the pool when I’ve dove underwater, and my ears popped. I tumbled forward and fell flat onto the sterile, linoleum floor of a hospital.
