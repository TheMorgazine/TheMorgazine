On Thursday while I was finishing up work, Elijah started to play around with a couple of golf balls that he found on the ground. I told him he needed to be careful to roll the balls, not throw them since they’re so hard, and showed him how he could drop them through things.

As he became more and more mesmerized by this I decided to set up something in the living room that he could play with. I grabbed two of our card tables from our garage, and set them ups that one was at a slight slant so that the balls would roll naturally. I also grabbed Kayla’s old wooden doll stage. I set the stage at the bottom of the slope so it would catch the golf balls.

We used a letter holder shaped like a dog to “launch” the gofl balls. The letter holder has a tube shape (picture a weiner dog made out of wires) so the balls just rolled through easily. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jonmorgan/videos/10154800922177665/">Elijah had tons of fun rolling the balls down the table</a>. There was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jonmorgan/videos/10154801134572665/">also a second video</a>.
