<h1>The Bug Park</h1>

The Central Park, or “Bug Park” as we referred to it, was a frequent destination when we lived on Clark street. I would take the kids there if we wanted to go somewhere, but I didn’t want to devote the time required to walk to and hang out at one of the parks that were farther.

As parks go, it is rather sparse. There is a jungle gym shaped like a giant ant. When we lived on Clark street, there was also a see saw.

As there are plans to change the park, I said to Kayla I wanted to get another set of pictures of her on the ant-shaped climbing bars while we had the opportunity. We had already been out that morning to take photos during the opening ceremonies of the new MMCC annex across from the Shepherd Elementary School.
