Dear Kayla,

I wanted to wish you a happy 17th Birthday. I’m very proud of everything you’ve achieved so far, but know that the best is yet to come. This is going to be a crazy year for all of us as you complete your senior year in high school. While I’m writing this, you’re touring CMU’s campus with your mom.

I also appreciate how much you’ve done to help out with your brothers. For example, helping Josh with his homework and being a fun big sister for Elijah.

Love,

Dad
