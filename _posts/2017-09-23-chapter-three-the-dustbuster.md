<h1>Three</h1>
As I approached the triage room I was overwhelmed by a flood of memories sparked by the sound of the heart monitor and the scent of disinfectant used on the hospital bed sheets. From other rooms there were the sounds of people crying, and one woman was struggling through her labor pains. It was a strange sensation, experiencing moment that at the same time you could recall experiencing exactly the same way seventeen years ago.

I peeked into the door, and saw a younger version of myself observing while a nurse checked a younger version of my wife, Theresa. Theresa was laying in bed, her legs up in stirrups. I was holding onto Theresa’s overnight bag, and it sounded like the nurse was saying that a labor and delivery room was going to become available soon.

I had paused to watch, but now decided to keep walking. Before I could step out of view, though, I could feel a familiar set of eyes on me. I could not resist looking back over, and found myself locking stares with my younger self. At first, it was a very eerie feeling. I continued on, but immediately discovered that it was very difficult to walk. My legs became heavy, and my surroundings began to twist around. For the second time that day, I dropped towards the floor.

“Jon...Jon!” I was startled awake by a sharp shove to my shoulder. I opened my eyes to find Theresa staring back at me. She looked very frustrated. “I can’t believe you fell asleep,” she said.

“I’m sorry..I must have been more tired than I thought,” I offered weakly. I glanced around, then down at my clothes. Not only was my lab coat missing, but the clothes I was wearing were different than the ones I had put on in the museum. In fact, my body was different.

Right then I was struck by the realization that I had somehow taken the form of my younger self, perhaps right after he had seen me.

Theresa was now looking worried. “They said we could switch to the delivery room. After we move there, why don’t you head down to the cafeteria for a few minutes and get something to eat? Maybe that will help you feel better.”

We talked only a little while we waited for a nurse to come to usher us over to the delivery room. Outside, it was raining like crazy.

Nurse Rachel appeared in the doorway with a wheelchair. I almost greeted her by name, then stopped myself. I gathered up our things, and then we switched over to our new room.

Once we were settled, I left the room under the pretense of grabbing some food but stopped by the janitor’s closet to retrieve my dufflebag. I double checked the contents to make sure that everything was there, and it was.

A few hours later, events unfolded just as I remembered them. After checking Theresa a few times, the nurses finally said that she was dilated enough to deliver. So, the doctor was called, and everyone worked on delivering our baby. It was strange going through it all over again. It felt familiar, but still brand-new. I still cried when Kayla was born.

I had told myself that I wouldn’t use my smartphone in the past, but I couldn’t resist the urge to snap a photo of Kayla while the nurses were giving her a checkup. Someone did see my iPhone and asked if that was a new kind of camcorder, and I just nodded silently.

My plan was to let events carry out as they had before, then attempt a time jump back to present time while I was downstairs in the cafeteria helping my niece, Allyson, buy something for dinner. I was just about to step away when I noticed a man wearing work overalls and heavy goggles step into the room. At first, I didn’t recognize him, but on a second glance I realized it was Larry. He was carrying a dustbuster just like mine.

I asked Allyson to find a table then hurried to catch Larry. “Larry?” I said.

“Jon? You’re so much younger, I almost didn’t recognize you,” he said. He stared at me for a few minutes, then added, “Wait. How are you younger?”

I described how I had seemed to merge with my past self when we made eye contact.

“That’s what I was afraid of,” Larry said. “You need to stop her.”

“Who?”

“Kayla, your daughter. She used the device to time travel here and see her own birth, but she doesn’t understand the risk. Time corrects itself when two versions of the same person come within proximity of each other.”

“What about me? I thought I’d just be able to jump back.”

“You can because you merged a forty year old mind with someone in their twenties. There’s no telling what happens to a person when they merge with a baby.” I noticed the fear in Larry’s face, and started to wonder how he could feel so certain about anything of this. When I left, time travel was new to both of us.

“Wait. How did you get here? Did you find another dustbuster?” I asked.

“No. I’m from your future, Jon. From my perspective, all of this has already happened. You asked me to stop it from happening.”

“I did?”

“You need to hurry. Right now, you’re the only one with access to the maternity floor.”

I returned to Theresa’s room, dropped off Allyson, then headed over to check on baby Kayla. As I rounded the corner, I spotted an adult Kayla standing outside the observation window. I swallowed hard, then grabbed her and pulled her away.

“Owe, hey!”

“Kayla!” I said. “What are you doing here?”

“Dad?” She said. “You’re so much..younger.”

“It’s a long story,” I said.

“I know, you told me some of it.”

“You can’t be here.”

“Well,” She retorted, “It was your idea. You said I should time travel.”

“I did?” I said, astonished. I was going to say more, but a passing nurse tapped me on the shoulder.

“Mr. Morgan?”

“Yes.”

“Your wife is asking for you.”

“I’ll be there.” I turned to Kayla, tried to get past my feelings of fear and dread, then said, “Leave. Don’t interact with anybody.”

“I won’t.” I saw in her eyes, though, that she wanted to stay.

My sister and her future husband were in the room when I returned. We talked, and then they asked about seeing Kayla. The nurses offered to bring the baby back. A few minutes later, a nurse returned with a contently sleeping Kayla her their arms.

I noticed the blonde hair, and realized that it was adult Kayla. The older Kayla handed the baby to Theresa. “She’s so beautiful,” she offered.

“She is,” my mother in law responded. She looked at Kayla. “Do you have kids?”

My daughter hesitated, as if she wanted to answer but couldn’t. I never heard the answer, however, because just then baby Kayla began to wake up. “Excuse me,” she said. She made it out of the room, but stopped at the threshold when she heard the baby’s crying. At first, she watched with wonderment but her expression slowly changed to pain. She tried to step farther back, but struggled at it. She moved as if she was suddenly underwater. I started moving towards her when I saw that she was starting to faint, but was too late. She had blinked out of existence by the time I had reached the hallway.

I glanced and stared back at my newborn daughter, who in the same moment had stopped crying.
