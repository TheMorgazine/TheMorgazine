“X-Files: Fight the Future” will always remind me of specific things: killer bees, black oil, and the funny faces Fox Mulder makes when he’s scared. The movie could very well be just another episode of X-Files, only with the bigger scope and higher production value made possible by the budget of a movie production. It is as if the show’s creator was told that he could “just go nuts,” and he did just that.

I love that this movie stayed true to the relationship between Mulder and Scully while moving the show’s alien conspiracy mythology forward in a big way.
