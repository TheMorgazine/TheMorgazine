The plan was simple. We made arrangements with a student at CMU who would come and babysit Kayla when the time came for us to deliver Josh. We even made arrangements for her to watch Kayla for a night beforehand, so that they could get to know each other and so Kayla would be comfortable with the idea.

But, as things turned out Theresa started having contractions one evening and no matter how many times we called our designated babysitter never answered. Finally, we decided to head to the hospital, so we scooped Kayla up out of her bed, loaded everyone into our van, and headed to the hospital.

At the hospital, the doctors confirmed that Theresa was in labor. I called my mom, and she agreed to drive up so that she could pick up Kayla and watch her at our apartment. By now, Kayla was wide awake. I kept her entertained by showing taking her down to see the fish aquarium in the lobby, and the nursery on the maternity floor.

Finally, I figured out that I could make a bed for Kayla to lay down on, and just as she started to fall asleep several things happened. First, when a nurse checked how Theresa was progressing she concluded that it was time to deliver our baby. And, second, my mom showed up.

Kayla slept through most of the delivery, but woke up almost as soon as Josh was born. And, they’ve been watching after each other ever since then.

It is also worth noting that my mom was in the room to witness Josh’s delivery. I handed her my camcorder so that I could focus on Theresa.

Josh has grown up into a caring, conscientious young man. He is also a helpful big brother to Elijah. I’m grateful to have Josh in my life, because we have a lot of shared interests that we can talk about: Star Wars, Nerf Guns, computers. He’s also taught me a thing or two over the years, like Minecraft. He has a quirky sense of humor and a great imagination.
