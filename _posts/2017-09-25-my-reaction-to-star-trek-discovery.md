The first episode of “Star Trek: Discovery,” titled “Vulcan Hello,” but what really should have been called, “Hey suckers, you only get to watch the first hour of this two-parter on CBS, so ha-ha!,” was mostly pretty good, but there were some parts that were a little hard to understand. Such as why the Klingons didn’t just transition to English like during “Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country.” Okay, I get it...you have an entire, made up Klingon language. It doesn’t mean we want to spend 15-20 minutes reading subtitles while people in makeup are basically grunting at each other.

The show has a lot going for it. Stylistically, everything is very interesting. In terms of plot, they moved immediately into the central conflict involving the Klingons. If the show was trying to explain the motivations for the Klingons, I think some of the it was lost on me because I was very distracted by the revamped designs.

So, I don’t think there’s any secret that there is a lot of talk about war with the Klingons in this episode. Without spoiling it, it basically went something like this: “Talk, talk talk talk, talk, ooh something happened, talk talk, something else happened, and--roll credits.”

I get that CBS is trying to start its own streaming service to rival Netflix, and maybe even get out of the “free broadcasting” game altogether. That’s their choice. But, I already pay for cable so that I can get their programming. If I wanted streaming, I’d choose Netflix over a one trick pony like CBS All Access. Because I don’t even spend a lot of time watching CBS at all, until tonight. Offering a quick nibble of a series and then locking the second half of what is obviously a two-episode story behind their paywall is just not fair.

I think that I must be just old fashioned about my TV watching. Antenna TV shows should be free, aside from any cable fees. TV networks should not use one lower tier property to advertise for programming that will be shown on their premium property.

Sadly, I think that the TV network model is doomed, and I think that the executives are realizing it as well. People want to go straight to the “source” for their programming, and networks want to be that source so they stay relevant. Now when people cut the cord, CBS’s All Access service is there for them. But, for me this only makes CBS less relevant in my life, and I’ll have to wait until “Star Trek: Discovery” becomes available outside of this streaming service--kind of how I got started watching the original series in the first place.

The other sad thing this is the way that they’ve offered this on Netflix internationally except for the US. If it was for everybody, then maybe I would have signed up for Netflix and watched it there. I already might sign up for a subscription to Netflix because of season two of “Stranger Things,” and in general for the other shows and movies that are offered there. But, they didn’t go this route, so in a way I’m blocked twice from seeing the series.

What CBS doesn’t understand is that in order to offer a streaming service that people will pay for, they first need to demonstrate that their service offers a value they can’t find anywhere else. If you are only offering mostly the same shows that you air on your broadcast network plus “Star Trek: Discovery,” then that’s not nearly enough to go on. A subscription wouldn’t be for a whole service, just for the one series. They might as well call it the “Star Trek Streaming Service.”

So, I guess I am looking forward to watching the rest of the season a year from now when it’s finally released on DVD, or it’s on Netflix, or whatever. In the meanwhile, I’ll be staying caught up with shows like “The Walking Dead,” which airs on a network that I know won’t jerk me around.

If anything, I don’t need to deal with crap like this. It’s just a reminder of how unimportant TV--even Star Trek on TV--is to my life. There are so many other more constructive ways I could spend my money, or even my time. And, the moment when i’m forced to prioritize my TV watching against other things in my life, is the moment that CBS loses my viewership. I think this is the same for a lot of people, and is another reason why their strategy isn’t going to work.
