This weekend, I took the kids to the Chippewa Nature Center during its Fall Festival. This was about our fourth visit to the center. For the previous times we had gone with Josh’s cub scout pack or with friends. Those had been “normal” days for the center compared to Saturday, so it was busier than ever.

This was Elijah’s second visit to the nature center. During his first, when I took him down to the shore of the river he had loved standing and just commenting on everything he saw. So, now that he is a little bit older I knew he was going to love it even more. It helped that it was a day when they were having the Fall festival, so there could be a little bit more for Josh and Kayla, who are older and had been there before, could do. But, as it turned out there really was enough to do without the extra activities, and they weren’t as into the special activities as maybe I had thought they would be.
<h2>The Visitor Center</h2>
The first place I took Elijah when we arrived at the nature center was the set of windows in the visitor’s center overlooking the Chippewa River. He immediately crouched down low and began chattering about everything he was seeing and asking questions.

We checked out all of the nature exhibits and stayed in the bird observatory for a little bit watching the squirrels fight each other over the bird seed that had fallen on the ground. Elijah asked tons of questions about what he was seeing and made up stories.
<h2>The Homestead</h2>
Once we had seen everything we could inside the visitor’s center, we walked out towards the homestead where a few of the other activities were taking place, and I knew we would be able to check out a few farm animals. The hike was long and tedious (as according to Josh) but eventually we made it there.

We found pigs, a sheep, and two cows. Next, we walked over to the one room schoolhouse.

There were a lot of fun things happening, but the older two weren’t so interested in them and there was a line for everything. So, we started back towards the visitor’s center. But, we couldn’t resist stopping by the river for a closer look.

It was really exciting to get my kids out into the woods a little bit and to immerse ourselves into nature. I wish that we were able to visit more often, because I can see how relaxing it would be just to sit and watch the river flow by, or to just sit and observe all of the different birds that land and feed off of the bird feeders. I think that if there is any lesson to take with us, it is that nature is everywhere and should be appreciated. This isn’t always easy when we live in the Village of Shepherd, but we still see some animals in our backyard, and the walking trail isn’t very far away. It’s just a matter of taking the time to stop and look or listen.

As usual, Elijah helped me to keep a fresh perspective on a lot of what we saw. I’ve seen a cow before, but it was fun seeing Elijah’s reaction.
