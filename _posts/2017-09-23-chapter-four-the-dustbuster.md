<h1>Four</h1>
When I saw the adult Kayla disappear, I knew that I had to stay and raise her all over again. I’d admit though, that it took until that evening before I was sure. It would mean leaving a life in 2017 that included a good job, two sons, a house, and Facebook. I would also experience a lot of painful events in my life all over again. Funerals, mistakes, and job changes.

Kayla was one month old when I realized I had made the right decision. She was crying in her crib. I came in to collect her, and as I picked her up I leaned close and whispered, “I know what happened.”

It could be my imagination, but she stopped crying as soon as I said this, and just stared back at me, as if she understood. As if she needed to know that I was there for her not only as a father, but as someone who understood what had really happened.

So, it has been a blessing to repeat what has always been the greatest adventure of my life. I’ve been there again for Kayla’s first steps, and I’ve attended her brother’s birth all over again.

I can’t say that I have done everything exactly the same way that I remember; I unsuccessfully tried to avoid being laid off at the Michigan State Medical Society and left an anonymous tip with the Secret Service warning about 9/11. But, where it comes to Kayla I haven’t changed anything.

I’ve kept the dustbuster and the suitcase, but haven’t needed either of them during the three years since I time traveled backwards from 2017. I’ve been thinking I might someday donate them to the historical society.
