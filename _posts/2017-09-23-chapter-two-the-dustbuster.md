<h1>Two</h1>
“Are you okay?” A young nurse with blonde curly hair had stopped to help. I accepted her hand, and she pulled me up off the floor.

“Yes, or I will be,” I said, glancing up at the ceiling behind me. I am not sure if I expected to see Larry peeking back at me, or what, but all there was now was ceiling tile. Had the doorway closed when I stepped through?

“Well, that’s good. Excuse me, though, doctor, but I’m late for my shift.”

“Oh, er, thank you.” I stammered. As soon as she was out of sight, I began looking for a place where I could collect my thoughts. I discovered, a couple of doors down, a lounge which was unoccupied.

Suddenly, the dustbuster emitted a loud, long chirp. I thought that it was warning me that the battery was almost dead, but when I looked at the battery indicator I could see that there was still some time left. A message on the screen read, “Scan complete. Press ‘1’ to print ID Card.” I pressed the “1.” Next, I was prompted for my name. When I was done, there was the sound of gears moving, and then a brand-new Sparrow Hospital ID Card was ejected out of the front of the device.

I grabbed it, and tucked the dustbuster into the duffle bag.

I needed to think.

Back in the museum--back in 2017--I had entered the year 9/23/2000, and the location Sparrow Hospital, thinking about what it might be like to experience my daughter’s birth all over again. And, here I was, seemingly inside the very same hospital where she had been born, and on the morning of that same day.

I headed for the nearest directory, located the maternity ward on the map, and then headed towards the nearest elevator.

The doors into the ward were locked, but somehow the ID card was enough to get me through. I hid my duffle bag in a janitor’s closet. I found a watch mixed in with the assortment of clothes. I had my smartphone, but I was hesitant to be caught using it.

The watch said that it was nearly 8 a.m. I headed towards the nurse’s station on the way towards the row of triage rooms. My younger self and wife would have still been in one of them.

“Doctor? Doctor?” Someone called. It was the nurse with the curly blonde hair.

I slowed to a stop in front of the nurse’s station, and grinned at the nurse. “Yes?” I asked.

“I didn’t realize that you worked in maternity,” She said.

“Well, they were busy tonight so I was asked to come in,” I said nonchalantly.

“Where’s your badge, Doctor--”

“Morgan, see?” I grabbed the ID and showed it to her. “I misplaced my clip.”

“Oh, you should have just asked,” she said, opening up a drawer. Inside, there was a entire stack of badge holders. “There you go.”

I slipped my card into the back and attached the clip to my coat. “Thanks.”

“Rachel,” she said.

“Jo--I mean, Joseph.”

“Joseph Morgan?”

“Yep.”

“Any relation to our patient in Triage room 2?” Rachel asked.

“I don’t know. There are a lot of Morgans.”

“I suppose so.” She shrugged, then turned her attention to the computer on her desk. “You don’t happen to know anything about computers, do you?”

“Well, a little,” I said, glancing at the screen. I recognized the “Start” button and the taskbar of Windows XP.

“I’m trying to read this file, but it won’t open.”

I drifted behind the nurse’s station, and took a closer look. “Well, I don’t think there’s an extension.” I made an adjustment to the settings in explorer so that all of the file’s extensions would display. The file Rachel wanted to open had an extension that didn’t conform to any program I had heard of.

“I think it’s an Acrobat file.”

“Oh, okay.” I changed the extension to “PDF.” “Now try it.”

She double clicked the document, and let out a giggle when it opened. “Wow, it worked! Thank you.”

“No problem,” I said. I waved, and slinked off towards Triage 2.
